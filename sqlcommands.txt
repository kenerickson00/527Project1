Command for creating the MyCube table, including the ThisQuarter column.

select
    Date_Part(year,OrderDate) as ThisYear
    ,concat('Q',Date_Part(quarter,OrderDate)) as ThisQuarter
    ,[Order_ShipCountry] as Region
    ,[ProductName] as Product
    ,[Order_Amount] as Sales
into
    MyCube
from
    ABC_Retail_Fact_Table
where
    [Order_ShipCountry] in ('USA','Canada','UK')
    and [ProductName] in ('Chai','Tofu','Chocolade')


Below are the pivot commands. First is the original, below it a command that does the same thing, but works
on mysql servers.

select Product, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
from MyCube PIVOT(SUM(Sales) FOR ThisQuarter IN (Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4)) AS P

select case when 1=1 then 'Sales' end as Product, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q1' then Sales else 0 end) as Q1,
sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q2' then Sales else 0 end) as Q2, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q3' then Sales else 0 end)
as Q3, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q4' then Sales else 0 end) as Q4 from MyCube


select Region, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
from MyCube PIVOT(SUM(Sales) FOR ThisQuarter IN (Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4)) AS P

select case when 1=1 then 'Sales' end as Region, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q1' then Sales else 0 end) as Q1,
sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q2' then Sales else 0 end) as Q2, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q3' then Sales else 0 end)
as Q3, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q4' then Sales else 0 end) as Q4 from MyCube



SELECT Product, Region, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
FROM (SELECT Product, Region, ThisQuarter, Sales FROM MyCube) AS p
PIVOT (sum(Sales) FOR ThisQuarter IN (Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4)) AS pvt

select case when 1=1 then 'Sales' end as Product, case when 1=1 then 'Sales' end as Region, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q1' then Sales else 0 end) as Q1,
sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q2' then Sales else 0 end) as Q2, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q3' then Sales else 0 end)
as Q3, sum(case when ThisQuarter='Q4' then Sales else 0 end) as Q4 from MyCube
